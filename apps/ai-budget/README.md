# AI Budget App

**Status: Template** - Angular application template with basic authentication structure

An Angular-based template application demonstrating modern Angular architecture patterns, featuring standalone components, dependency injection, and a feature-based project structure ready for AI-powered budget management development.

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 19** - Latest Angular with standalone components
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and modern ES features
- **RxJS** - Reactive programming for async operations
- **Angular Router** - Declarative routing with lazy loading
- **Vite** - Fast development builds via Nx integration

## Template Architecture

### Current Structure
- 🏗️ **Standalone Components** - Modern Angular without NgModules
- 🔐 **Authentication Template** - Login components and auth service structure
- 🚀 **Feature-based Organization** - Scalable project structure
- 📡 **API Service Layer** - Prepared for backend integration
- 🧭 **Routing Configuration** - Lazy loading and route guards ready
