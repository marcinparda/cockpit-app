## Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Start todo app in development mode
nx serve todo

# Run tests
nx test todo

# Lint code
nx lint todo

# Type check
nx typecheck todo
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
nx build todo

# Preview production build
nx preview todo
```

## Production Deployment

The Todo app is containerized using Docker and deployed to production infrastructure. The application serves real users and handles production workloads with:

- **Performance optimization** - Vite production builds with asset optimization
- **Docker containerization** - Multi-stage builds for minimal production images
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript coverage preventing runtime errors
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach for cross-device compatibility

## Integration with Shared Libraries

- **UI Components** - Uses `@cockpit-app/shared-vue-ui` for consistent design
- **API Types** - Leverages `@cockpit-app/api-types` for type-safe HTTP operations
- **Data Access** - `@cockpit-app/todo-data-access` for business logic separation
